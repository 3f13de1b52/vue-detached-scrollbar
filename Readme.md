# Vue Detached Scrollbar

This is a simple scrollbar that you can detach from the element that you want to scroll in. It comes with a minimal HTML structure.

It's still in the beta phase.


### Installation

Simple type

```sh
npm install vue-detached-scrollbar
```

Obviously, you'll need Vue.js to run it.

### To-do

* Write a proper documentation
* Explain how to use the package in detail
* Make a demo page to illustrate how it works

### Development

Want to contribute? I can only work on this project on my free time so any help is welcome.
